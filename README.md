# odin-sstea-restaurant
Hello! This website marks yet another milestone that I've reached in The Odin Project, this one being the third project in their JS Course. This one made me use webpack to merge multiple files under src together into a more compact package that users can access (if I remember correctly), and is the first project so far where I've ventured beyond just index, styles and javascript.

It was a very fun learning process, the most challenging part to me was getting the hang of working with the loads of extra files here, but luckily the bulk of it (figma and using JS to make HTML) was pretty doable. 

### The End Product: SSTea
A play on words (if you know me personally, yould understand, I swear), SSTea Incorporated is the place you want to go whenever you're desiring a good meal. It packs an awesome selection of starters, main courses, drinks and desserts, and is also completely fictional.

Despite that, I've worked my imagination a bit to make an entire website revolving about this!
It contains 5 pages:
1. The homepage, which lets users know what its about, and how much it's loved by the public;
2. The first menu page dedicated to starters;
3. A second menu page for main courses;
4. And a third menu page for drinks and desserts. All three menu pages show pictures, descriptions and tags for each dish.
5. To wrap up, a Contact Us page, filled with random people I found off the internet. There's also a little form at the bottom that does completely nothing.

About it doing nothing much except looking good, all I can say in my defense is that I don't have all the time in the world. The JS Course has a whopping TWELVE projects and I am ***not*** spending a month making this look AND work top-tier. (I work insanely slowly, my brainpower is limited, and the abovementioned time issue too.)

Despite all that said, this is one of the most high-effort sites I've made so far. (One entire week on this, way longer than my other projects) I actually spent time refining the design a lot, and I'm very happy with how it turned out. 

Now I'm gonna slog on the next odin project thing like the absolute no-lifer I am. bye
